- more than one owners per house: change something?
- things to be interactive:
    1) threshold for fine particles
    2) threshold for harmful gas
    3) threshold for humidity
- .json file: additionalFeature: just the ones you put??
- possibility to build house with different rooms and equipments
- Add new sensors and equipment
- Implement scenario 1 :
    - Alarm System
    - Light turn on/off auto
    - Heaters
    - Smart Assistant :
        - Change temperature
        - Find objects
- Create and implement scenario 3
- Look for useful design patterns:
    - Singleton
    - Factory Pattern
    - Observer
- Modify Parameterization to be able to check if something is implemented (room / equipment / sensor / feature...)

- fix in CommunicationHub: owner.getOwner().getAirQT()
- ask if the variability should be implemented inside the parametrization.java in order to choose which things, present in the configuration file, we want to "import"
- how things change if we change the configuration file?
- find a way to let things work (same scenario) for different kind of house: how will the house detect a falling if there's no falling detector? how we
