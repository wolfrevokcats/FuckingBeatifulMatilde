- more than one owners per house: change something?
- things to be interactive:
    1) threshold for fine particles
    2) threshold for harmful gas
    3) threshold for humidity
- .json file: additionalFeature: just the ones you put??
- Add new sensors and equipment
- Create and implement scenario 3:
- Look for useful design patterns:
    - Singleton V
    - Factory Pattern
    - Observer
- Modify Parameterization to be able to check if something is implemented (room / equipment / sensor / feature...): check in: call alarm/room that doesn't exist


- how things change if we change the configuration file?
- find a way to let things work (same scenario) for different kind of house: how will the house detect a falling if there's no falling detector? how we

- fix the class diagram (put the design patterns)
- add 2 scenarios (3 to be implemented: 1-2-3)

- SQUINTIN:
    1) Scenario 1
    2) Parametrization
    3)
- SMAFLIN:
    1) Scenario 3
    2) Find some design patterns
